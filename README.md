## Objective
> The objective of the project is to create a deep learning network which classifies signatures as genuine and forgery using Siamese networks with the help of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02131)
## Dataset
> The dataset that I have used is ICDAR 2011 dataset, which can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hFljH9AKhxxIqH-3fj72mCMA6Xh3Vv0m)
